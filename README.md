# Apsis
Apsis is a prototype server using the _Encoding for Robust Immutable Storage_ [spec](https://eris.codeberg.page/spec/).
## How it works
Files or JSON data encoded using ERIS are split up into encrypted blocks and stored in the database. Individual blocks are also advertised via the Bittorrent Mainline DHT. When Apsis is missing a block, it performs a lookup on the DHT for the missing block and fetches it from another instance of Apsis.

Apsis exposes a simple API based on [RFC2169](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2169), extended to support file uploads. An HTTP `POST` to `/uri-res/R2N` will upload the data (such as a JSON string or arbitrary file) and return an ERIS URN (a matching token in the `Authorization` header is required to upload). An HTTP `GET` to `/uri-res/N2R?<ERIS URN>` will return the data.

A simple client, `apsisctl`, is provided for convenience but it's almost equally simple to use `curl`.

**NOTE:** For block discovery, this has the same network limitations as seeding a file with Bittorrent, namely the `apsisd` instance serving a block needs to have its port exposed to the internet.
